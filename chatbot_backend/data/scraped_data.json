By combining personalized digital therapy with professional care, Caspar Health ensures patients receive the best possible outcomes.We wanted to create a solution that empowers clinics while keeping patients at the center of care.Sergiej Rewiakin, Head of Tech at CasparWhen it came to improving communication between patients and healthcare professionals, Caspar Health turned to TalkJS for a reliable and scalable chat solution.About Caspar HealthCaspar Healths mission is to make high-quality rehabilitation accessible to everyone. Their platform combines digital therapy with expert care, allowing clinics to enhance patient outcomes without overburdening staff.Recognized by the German Pension Fund in 2022, Caspar Health is a trusted provider of digital prevention, rehabilitation, and aftercare.We focus on individual needs, high treatment quality, and long-lasting therapeutic success, Rewiakin explains.Caspar Health appThe ChallengeCaspar Healths existing legacy chat system was holding them back. It lacked scalability and customization, two key factors for their growing platform.They faced two major challenges with their existing chat provider. First, their US-based provider, Sendbird, didnt comply with the strict data security regulations required by their German operations. Ensuring compliance with European standards was a top priority.We needed a solution that was reliable, customizable, and capable of handling a large user base.Sergiej Rewiakin, Head of Tech at CasparSecond, they needed a messaging solution that met their technical and user experience needs. For example, a critical feature like the ability to mark messages as unread wasnt available on Sendbird. Additionally, reliability was essential for their platform, which supports around 50,000 monthly active users.The challenge was finding a chat system that integrated seamlessly while maintaining a user-friendly experience.The SolutionTalkJS stood out to the Caspar Health team as the ideal solution. Its reliable infrastructure, extensive customization options, and responsive support made it the perfect choice.TalkJS offered a great balance of features and support at an affordable price. The integration process was one of the smoothest weve experienced, says Rewiakin.To ensure seamless implementation, TalkJS set up a dedicated Slack channel for real-time collaboration with Caspar Healths developers. Within days, the team had a fully functional chat system embedded into their platform.Caspar Health chatThe ResultsBy adopting TalkJS, Caspar Health improved communication between patients and healthcare professionals, enhancing engagement and operational efficiency.The team is thrilled with how TalkJS aligns with our needs. Its startup-friendly, approachable, and incredibly flexible, Rewiakin shares.Today, TalkJS supports Caspar Healths mission to deliver effective and innovative rehabilitation solutions, helping clinics stay at the forefront of the digital health market.

Keep reading to learn everything about how they integrated a buyer-seller chat into their marketplace.Weve seen a 3x increase in booking conversion compared to our previous experience, where we provided a masked-SMS solution.- Sean Elliot, Engineering Manager at StyleSeatAbout StyleSeatStyleSeat is the online destination for beauty  wellness professionals and their clients. Professionals can showcase their work, connect with new and existing clients, and build their business. Clients can discover new services and providers, book appointments online, and get inspired.The challengeThe style and wellness industry is very dynamic. There are a ton of things that go into a successful appointment. Giving professionals an easy way to communicate in real time with their clients helps them set the appointment up for success. Helping to answer questions about which service to book, how to prepare for the appointment, and of course being able to answer last-minute questions about hours or location are all ways in which weve been able to help make that communication better.StyleSeat already offered ways for professionals to get in touch with their clients, but the solutions were asynchronous and conversations frequently happened off the platform via SMS, email, etc.. They wanted to give professionals one place where they could easily manage all of their conversations and wanted to do it as soon as possible.We wanted to understand as quickly as possible what value would be added by introducing real time communication for our professionals and their clients. Again, this was a reason we chose TalkJS -- it appeared to be able to deliver a robust experience very quickly, and that is what weve seen so far.- Sean Elliot, Engineering Manager at StyleSeatThe solutionTalkJS offered all of the hard requirements and many of the nice-to-haves out of the box. Compared to the other third-party solutions they considered, TalkJS also had the easiest chat implementation and great documentation. Additionally, the estimate they received when considering an internal build was a non-starter for a feature they wanted to test quickly.Because implementing TalkJS was as fast and easy as it was, we were able to greenlight and move this project along very quickly. Had we not chosen this path, the feature would have either been delayed, or shelved due to the resources needed to implement it.- Sean Elliot, Engineering Manager at StyleSeatThe resultsStyleSeat witnessed amazing results when they switched to TalkJS. Their outdated SMS solution was causing a loss of transactions by leaking customers away from their platform. TalkJS filled in the gaps by providing real-time messaging and exceptional chat moderation tools.Weve seen a 3x increase in booking conversion compared to our previous experience, where we provided a masked-SMS solution. As we roll out new features and bring the new experience to a wider audience, we hope to see other important conversion metrics impacted as well.- Sean Elliot, Engineering Manager at StyleSeat Share Share Share Share Share Email Copy Read next Product  Dec 9, 2024 How to pick the best white-label chat 2025 Discover the best white-label chat solutions with this expert guide.

This is a bit like a login session in your own app, except that users dont directly log in to TalkJS. Instead, you ensure that users can only have a TalkJS session when they have a valid session in your app.Creating a session is typically the first thing youll do when using TalkJS from JavaScript1const me  new Talk.User2 id 12345,3 name Dennis Vargas,45const session  new Talk.Session6 appId APP_ID,7 me me,8As you can see in the code example above, a session describes a connection between a user, your TalkJS account, and, implicitly, the browser or device the user is currently on.Youll need to replace APP_ID with your TalkJS App ID. You can find your App ID in the Settings tab of the TalkJS dashboard.When to start a sessionWe recommend that you start a TalkJS session right after the user logs in, on every page - even ones where users cant read or write messages. This way, TalkJS can show desktop notifications and trigger JavaScript events everywhere. This should not impact the performance of your app in any way because the core chat library is loaded asynchronously and very small.If your app is a server-side rendered web app, we recommend that you start a session on every page load.Session lifecycleA session exists from creation until the user navigates away from the page or closes the tab.If your app allows your user to log out without unloading the page, we recommend that you destroy the session using the sessions destroy method.Session securityTalkJS uses authentication identity verification to ensure thatThe user is who they say they areThe user has a valid login session on your appThis way, a TalkJS Session can only exist when the user is logged into your app, and not otherwise.

We wanted to learn more about their setup, so we sat down with Matt Harrison, their VP of Strategy.If not for the chat we would continue to devalue our brand by not having FreeUp front and center with both clients and freelancers at all times.- Matt Harrison, VP of Strategy at FreeUpAbout FreeUpFreeUp is one of the largest marketplaces that connects businesses with pre-vetted freelancers. They recruit and interview hundreds of freelancers every week, only allowing the top 1 into the network. Working with FreeUp will rid you of frustrations like making bad hires, freelancers disappearing, and long interview processes.The platform makes it easy for business owners find the top 1 of virtual assistants, freelancers, and agency applicants in eCommerce, digital marketing, and web development.The challengeThe product team was aware that having users communicate only via email was an issue. They were just not sure how much it was impacting their platform. Essentially, they wanted to provide a better hiring experience for both businesses and freelancers.We understood that in order to better our product we needed both clients and freelancers to work within the platform and not via emails only.- Matt Harrison, VP of Strategy at FreeUpFreeUp is a marketplace where thousands of users are trying to get in contact with each other. It just made sense to integrate a chat feature and connect the supply and demand sides of the marketplace.We wanted to bring clients and freelancers together seamlessly within our app with chat- Matt Harrison, VP of Strategy at FreeUpThe solutionThe main reason FreeUp went with TalkJS is the pre-built chat UI. It made it easy to embed the chat into the platform without doing much design and frontend work. To customize the look of the UI, the devs used the TalkJS Themes Editor to change a couple of lines of CSS, and the UI was ready.We considered SendBird and OpenTok, but chose TalkJS because it was easy to deploy.- Matt Harrison, VP of Strategy at FreeUpAnother upside is an easy way to monitor the chat activity in the dashboard. The marketplace admins can get an overview of all conversations going on. In case a dispute happens between a business and a freelancer, they can easily view the messages and solve the issue.Now we can see how many clients and freelancers are interacting with one another. We can look at our dashboard and get broad overviews of what is happening within the application.- Matt Harrison, VP of Strategy at FreeUpThe resultsUsing the TalkJS chat API made the integration super easy without causing a significant workload on the dev team. Now, the users dont have to switch from FreeUp to email. They could easily chat on the platform, which does wonders for the hiring experience and overall brand perception.If not for the chat we would continue to devalue our brand by not having FreeUp front and center with both clients and freelancers at all times.- Matt Harrison, VP of Strategy at FreeUp Share Share Share Share Share Email Copy Read next Product  Dec 9, 2024 How to pick the best white-label chat 2025 Discover the best white-label chat solutions with this expert guide.

Guest access is a lightweight access mode that can scale to larger numbers of users compared to normal participant access. Guests can read and send messages but cannot be mentioned or receive notifications, and they will not appear in the participant list of conversations. See Participant access and guest access for more details.In the guide well walk you through installing TalkJS, viewing a conversation, and creating a new user and conversation.You can only allow users to join a large group chat as guests in combination with a chatbox or popup pre-built chat UI, and not with an inbox UI.PrerequisitesTo make the most of this guide, you will need a TalkJS account.You might also already have an existing app that you want to add TalkJS to.Add TalkJS to your appAdd the following script to your app to load TalkJSHTML1!-- minified snippet to load TalkJS without delaying your page --2script3functiont,a,l,k,j,s4sa.createElementscripts.async1s.srchttpscdn.talkjs.comtalk.jsa.head.appendChilds5kt.Promiset.Talkv3,readythenfunctionfifkreturn new kfunctionr,el.pushf,r,el6.pushf,catchfunctionreturn knew k,clwindow,document,7scriptThen, for a chatbox pre-built chat UI, include this container element in the place in which you want to add your chatHTML1!-- container element in which TalkJS will display a chat UI --2div idtalkjs-container stylewidth 90 margin 30px height 500px3 iLoading chat...i4divIf youre adding a popup UI, you can omit this container, as the popup gets overlaid on top of your page.

Youll need to replace APP_ID with your own app ID, which you can find on the Settings page of your TalkJS dashboard. For this tutorial, we recommend using the app ID for TalkJSs Test Mode, which has built-in sample users and conversations which well use in this tutorial. Youll also need to specify a current user to send messages as. In this example, weve set me to be an existing user, the sample_user_alice sample user. For a user that already exists, we can call the Talk.User constructor with just their user ID.Next, use the getOrCreateConversation method to fetch the existing conversation with an ID of sample_large_group_chat.Then you create the chat UI. Call the createChatbox method for a chatbox, createInbox for an inbox, or createPopup for a popup UI. Use the select method to display the sample conversation, and then use the mount method to render the UI. The methods here are linked for the chatbox, but are also available on the inbox and popup UI.For example, for the chatbox UI, you should see something like thisLoading chat...Try sending a message!If you dont see the chat window, make sure that you entered your app ID, replacing APP_ID in the code.Create a new guest user and conversationsSo far in this guide weve used a sample user and conversation. Next, well create new users and a conversation between them, and sync them with the TalkJS servers. Usually, you would create users based on the data from your database. For this getting started guide, weve hard-coded our user data instead.Modify your previous code by changing the highlighted linesChatboxPopupJavaScript1Talk.ready.thenfunction  2 const me  new Talk.User3 id nina,4 name Nina,5 email email protected,6 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-7.jpg,7 welcomeMessage Hi!,8 9 const session  new Talk.Session10 appId APP_ID,  replace with your app ID11 me me,12 13 14 const conversation  session.getOrCreateConversationnew_conversation15 16 const chatbox  session.createChatbox17 chatbox.selectconversation,  asGuest true 18 chatbox.mountdocument.getElementByIdtalkjs-container19Heres what were doing in the updated versionWe create a new user with an ID of nina to be our current user. As this user is new, we pass the full user object to the Talk.User constructor rather than just the user ID.We create a TalkJS session and add our new current user as in the previous section.We use the getOrCreateConversation method to create a new conversation with an ID of new_conversation, and then add the two new users to the conversation with the setParticipant method.We create the UI, select the conversation with asGuest true, and mount the UI as in the previous section.When you mount the UI, the new user and conversation are synced with the TalkJS servers.You should now see something like thisIf you prefer, you can instead create and sync users or conversations from your backend with our REST API. If you want to only sync users or conversations with the REST API, you can disable syncing in the browser. See Browser Synchronization for more details.Next stepsIn this guide, youve added powerful group chat to your app. You also learned more about the fundamentals of TalkJS, and how it all fits together.Most importantly, youve built a starting point to try out all the features TalkJS offers. For example, you could create a new UI theme in the Theme Editor, customize your chat with action buttons or HTML panels, or enable email notifications.For more ideas, try browsing the many examples we offer for different use cases.Before you go live, make sure you enable authentication.

Test mode is intended for developing and testing your application, whereas live mode is for use in production.When you sign up for TalkJS, you get access to test mode, which is free to use. Your chat UI will have a banner saying Youre in TalkJS Test Mode, and your data will not be backed up as frequently as in live mode.To use TalkJS in your production environment, you need to subscribe to one of our plans and switch to live mode.Switch your application to live modeTo switch to live mode, follow these steps.Access live mode settingsFirst, access the settings for live mode in your dashboard. To do this, go to the Settings page in your TalkJS dashboard, and toggle the switch in the top bar of the dashboard to Viewing live modeReplace your app ID and secret keyYour test mode and live mode each come with a different app ID and secret key. Once you\u00e2ve switched to live mode settings in the dashboard, you can find the app ID and secret key for your live environment on the Settings page, in the General section.In the code where you add TalkJS to your application, make sure that all instances of appID match the app ID for your live mode. If you already had the app ID for your test mode in your code, that means you have to replace all instances of the test mode app ID with your live mode app ID.For example, in the following code snippet, replace APP_ID with your live mode app ID1const session  new Talk.Session2 appId APP_ID,  replace with your own live mode app ID3 me me,4If you use the REST API, you will also need to update your secret key in your requests.Note If your application or website has multiple environments \u00e2 for instance, a test environment and a production environment \u00e2 that use different TalkJS environments, it might be a good idea to store your live mode and test mode TalkJS credentials as environment variables in your code. This allows you to try out new themes, roles, or any other customization on your test environment before going live to production with any changes.Publish your theme changes to live modeIf you have created or edited any themes in the Theme Editor, you will need to publish them to live mode. To publish your themes, go to the Themes page of the dashboard.From the overview of themes in the UI themes section, select the theme that you\u00e2d like to use in your live app, and select the Publish to live buttonIf you\u00e2re using multiple themes, repeat the process of publishing to live for each theme.Publish your Chat UI settings changes to live modeIf you have made any changes to the settings in the Chat UI section of the dashboard either by editing the default role or by creating new roles, you will need to publish them to live mode. To publish the chat UI settings for a role, go to the Chat UI page of your dashboard, and select the Publish to live buttonFor example, to publish the chat UI settings for the default role, make sure that default is selected in the section Editing settings for role ROLE in your test environment., and then select Publish to live.Note Chat UI settings always apply to a specific user role. If you don\u00e2t specify anything else, your users get the default role. You can leave the role at default and never think about it again. However, if you want different chat UI settings to apply to different user types \u00e2 for example buyer and seller, or student and teacher \u00e2 then you could create different roles, and assign different UI settings to each role.If you are using multiple roles, make sure to publish the chat UI settings for each of those roles to live.Data in live and test environmentsYour test mode and live mode environments do not share conversations, users or other data. This allows you to have separate test data in your test environment that you can modify and repopulate as you need.If you do want data from your test mode in live mode for example, if you have migrated from another chat provider and have first tested your data import in test mode, you will need to use the REST API to export your test mode data and import it into live mode. For guidance on this, see our Import messages page.",

For a deep dive into this particular application, we spoke with Peter Lu, Head of Product at RapidSOS.TalkJS just works and is reliable. We absolutely would recommend TalkJS to others.- Peter Lu, Head of Product at RapidSOSAbout RapidSOSRapidSOS is an intelligent safety platform provider based in New York City. The company is taking the antiquated analog-based 911 system and moving it into the digital era. Whether theres an unsafe moment or an emergency, RapidSOS devices, homes, or buildings deliver essential data to the right place, when it matters most. It securely links life-saving data from 500M connected devices, apps and sensors to RapidSOS safety agents, 911 and field responders globally.The ChallengeIn 911 scenarios and other critical emergencies, RapidSOS cannot afford any errors. The communication system must be reliable at all times. Additionally, addressing privacy concerns related to sensitive user data is extremely important. This necessitated RapidSOS to find a way to self-host their messaging solution. And they also required support for a video format that wasnt supported by some of the platforms they were evaluating.We have a specific use case and we needed the platform to address our personally identifying information PII and security concerns.- Peter Lu, Head of Product at RapidSOSWhy TalkJSWhen RapidSOSs product team determined that creating their own chat system wasnt feasible, they sought a self-hostable messaging solution. This led them to opt for the on-premise version of TalkJS.The main reason we chose TalkJS was their reputation, APIs and ability to host the solution.- Peter Lu, Head of Product at RapidSOSRapidSOS found that integrating with TalkJS was seamless, especially when used with Kubernetes for self-hosting. Moreover, when they needed support for the specific video format mentioned before, the TalkJS team quickly accommodated their request.If youre interested in TalkJS you can get all your questions answered by one of our solutions experts.

This personalised attention creates a quality customer experience and improves the reputation of your marketplace.Getting started guide Let buyers get in touch with sellers in real-timeBuyers might need to know more about a product before they feel confident in making a purchase.

For an example of a basic Svelte app with TalkJS that doesnt use SvelteKit, see our TalkJS Svelte example GitHub repo.PrerequisitesTo make the most of this tutorial, you needA TalkJS accountA basic understanding of SvelteA Svelte app to add TalkJS to. If you don\u00e2t have an existing Svelte app yet, follow these steps to create one.Install TalkJSTo get started, install TalkJS in your Svelte appnpmyarnSHELL1npm install talkjs --saveCreate a chat componentThe details of how and where you want to integrate TalkJS will depend on your app. For this example, create a componentsChat.svelte component in your project. In this component, you can import TalkJS1 Chat.svelte2script3 import Talk from talkjs4scriptFor either a chatbox or an inbox pre-built chat UI, also add a container element in which to load your chat1 Chat.svelte2script3 import Talk from talkjs4script5 6div idtalkjs-container styleheight 600pxLoading chats..divIf youre adding a popup UI, you can omit this container, as the popup gets overlaid on top of your page.

Youll need to replace APP_ID with your own app ID, which you can find on the Settings page of your TalkJS dashboard. For this tutorial, we recommend using the app ID for TalkJSs test mode, which has built-in sample users and conversations which well use in this tutorial. Youll also need to specify a current user to send messages as. In this example, youre setting me to be an existing user, the sample_user_alice sample user. For a user that already exists, we can call the Talk.User constructor with just their user ID.Next, use the getOrCreateConversation method to fetch the existing conversation with an ID of sample_conversation.Then you create the chat UI. Call the createChatbox method for a chatbox, createInbox for an inbox, or createPopup for a popup UI. Use the select method to display the sample conversation, and then use the mount method to render the UI. The methods here are linked for the chatbox, but are also available on the inbox and popup UI.For example, for the chatbox UI, you should see something like the followingLoading chat...Try sending Sebastian a message! You can also try switching your user ID to sample_user_sebastian and viewing the other side of the conversation.If you dont see the chat window, make sure that you entered your app ID, replacing APP_ID in the code.Create new users and conversationsSo far in this guide weve used a sample user and conversation.

We had a talk with Virdienash Haqmal, their Chief Product Officer, to learn everything about how they integrated a buyer-seller chat into Itemku.Itemku is currently the most popular marketplace for virtual gaming goods in Indonesia, offering everything from PC games to mobile apps and streaming subscriptions.The challengeThe product team from Itemku found out that buyers sometimes didnt get the correct delivery or had issues with virtual goods they bought. They wanted to fix that by providing a way for buyers to contact the sellers right after checkout.The thing is, Itmeku did have a messaging solution in place, one they built in-house, but nobody was using it as it was pretty rudimentary. No way to send attachments or chat in real-time. Not to mention push and email notifications.The idea was to switch to a general-purpose chat API to get all the features they need and ship fast while not clogging their roadmap.We were worried about the impact on our resources. Chat is not a core function for our platform.- Virdienash Haqmal, CPO at Itemku Five JackIntegrating the buyer-seller chatThe product team from Itemku used the TalkJS chat API and Javascript chat library to build a 1-on-1 private chat and embed it into their marketplace. The integration was straightforward. The developers copy-pasted the TalkJS snippet into a div and turned it into a real-time inbox. They set it up to make the chat accessible after the buyer finished the checkout.The API brought many advanced features like out-of-the-box notifications of all types and file sharing. In addition, the SDK provided an entirely pre-built UI that is highly customizable and made the frontend part of the integration much easier.We wanted good system stability and were also looking at Sendbird. Went with TalkJS because it was cost efficient compared to the market.- Virdienash Haqmal, CPO at Itemku Five JackHere you can see the Itemku UI with a contact list on the right.

Roles allow you to adjust all these settings for specific groups of users.Within a chat, different users can have different roles. A user can have only a single role at any time. You control which user gets which role.Role settingsA role allows you to define the following settings for a user.GeneralSelect general chat features and actions that are available to a userShow typing indicatorsAllow file sharingAllow location sharingAllow mentionsDisplay online status indicatorsAllow recording voice messagesUI themeSelect a theme to change the look-and-feel of the user interface.Actions and permissionsSelect the actions that users are able to perform on individual messages and on conversationsBuilt-in message actions delete, edit, reply to, or give an emoji reaction to a message.Built-in conversation actions leave a conversation, or mark a conversation as unread.Custom message actionsCustom conversation actionsGeneral notificationsSet the timeout of the period of inactivity after which a notification should be sent to a user.

If you signed up before that date, then users created without a role have no role automatically assigned.Create a roleGo to the Roles page on your dashboard.

Some messaging apps use words like chat, chatroom or channel for this concept. Any sort of conversation, from a brief 1-on-1 chat to a continuously active 20-person chat room, is called a conversation in TalkJS.A conversation has one or more participants and zero or more ordered messages.Group chats vs 1-on-1 chatsTalkJS does not fundamentally differentiate between one-on-one conversations and group conversations. Theyre all just conversations.Any conversation with more than two participants is treated as a group conversation. TalkJS treats these conversations slightly different. For example, sender names are shown in the message bubbles in group conversations and not in one-on-one conversations.If you add a third participant to a one-on-one conversation, then it automatically turns into a group conversation.The conversation IDEvery conversation needs to have a unique ID that you choose. Choosing your own conversation ID keeps you firmly in control of the granularity of a conversation. For example, should any two people who chat have a single, continuous conversation? Or should there be a new, separate conversation for every purchase or transaction, even if two given users may have multiple transactions?Here are three ways in which TalkJS customers often choose a conversation ID1. One conversation per purchaseIf your app tracks purchases or transactions or something similar, and you want to have a single conversation for every purchase, then it may be very effective to use your internal purchase ID as a conversation ID. One purchase, one conversation. Simple!2. One conversation per two usersHowever, if you just want to create a conversation between two specific users, then inventing and storing a conversation ID might be cumbersome. In that case, it might be better to use a conversation ID that is derived from the user IDs that will participate in the conversation.Our JS SDK provides a helper function, Talk.oneOnOneId that does exactly that it orders two user IDs alphabetically, combines them, and hashes the result. This way, invoking it for any two users will always yield the same conversation ID.See its page on the JS SDK reference for detailed information about how it works. If you also use the REST API, then you may need to replicate its behavior in your backend language. oneOnOneId has been designed to be easy to replicate in all popular languages and if its not then well gladly help.3. One conversation per topic channel  chat roomIf you use TalkJS to make semi-public chat rooms that are divided based on the topic of conversation, then you can use a short description of the conversations purpose as the conversation ID. For example, a public conversation to discuss software development could have the conversation ID dev. Then use setParticipant or the REST API to add the current user to dev.Securing the conversationIt might be easy for users to guess other users conversation IDs. Thats a risk, because it means that they may be able to join conversations theyre not supposed to be a part of.For example, if you take approach 1 above, and purchase IDs are auto-incrementing, then a user who gets added to conversation 12345 about purchase 12345 may be able to deduct that theres also a conversation 12344. If theyre tech savvy, they could enter some TalkJS calls in the browser developer tools and join conversation 12344.This is a risk if the underlying IDs are predictable for instance, because theyre incrementing numbers and not UUIDs, or if the IDs can be easily looked up by looking at public URLs, JavaScript source code, and so on.Hard-to-predict IDsA pragmatic approach to prevent this is to make the conversation ID hard to predict. You can do this easily and securely by computing an HMAC of the logical conversation ID. Youd then use the result of the HMAC signature as the real conversation ID.For example, if your backend is written in RubyRUBY1require openssl2 3 assume that purchase is some database record about the current purchase4predictable_conversation_id  purchase.id5conversation_id  OpenSSLHMAC.hexdigestsha256, SOMERANDOMSECRET, predictable_conversation_idThe SOMERANDOMSECRET string can be any secret, just a random sequence of characters is fine. Securely store it in the backend as you would any other secret.This is similar to one of our legacy authentication methods. The docs for that authentication method contain many code examples for hashing a string in different languages.AlternativesIf you need more control over who can access conversations, you can also disable synchronizing conversation data via the browser entirely. If you do this, then you can only create or modify conversations via the REST API, so then it does not matter if conversation IDs are easy to predict.Conversations in the inboxA conversation only shows up in the conversation list in the Inbox pre-built chat UI, if the conversation contains at least one message. This is to ensure that the conversation list only shows conversations in which there is activity, and to avoid overwhelming the user with empty conversations.To make a conversation show up in the conversation list, you can send either a system message or a user message on behalf of a user to that conversation. An automatic welcome message set at the user level doesnt make the conversation show up in the conversation list of an inbox.Conversation dataFieldTypeDescriptionidstringAs described above. Examples 12345, 9c686648d9f4, purchase12345customer6789subjectstringOptional. Describes the conversation in a human-friendly way. TalkJS will display it above the conversation and optionally in the Inboxs conversation feed. You can include some limited wiki-style formatting here.Examples House by the sea, House httpsexample.com\u00c7by the seaphotoUrlstringOptional. The URL of a photo or icon for this conversation. Displayed in the chat UI instead of a user photo. Recommended in group conversations, because otherwise TalkJS falls back to a placeholder picture.Example httpstalkjs.comimagesavatar-1.jpgwelcomeMessagesstringOptional. An array of strings which will be rendered as System Messages at the start of this conversation.Example Hey there!, Were usually online during office hourscustomobject of stringsJSON-structured custom data that you wish to associate to this conversation. TalkJS does nothing with this data except make it available in the events that we send to your code and in your EmailSMS notification templates. You can use custom data for all kinds of purposes, such as customizing a users email notification text, or transmitting contextual conversation data such as internal database IDs that this conversation relates to.Example purchaseId 12345Must be an object with string keys and string values arbitrarily deeply nested JSON is not supported. If you need structured data for one of your custom fields, consider serializing it yourself using e.g. JSON.stringify or similar functions.

This lets you stay in control of communication so you can jump in when necessary and delete messages.Mask contact informationPrevent users from exchanging email addresses, phone numbers, and website addresses. You can configure exceptions in detail.Analyse overall user activityTake a look at the analytics to see how many people are using the chat and the number of messages theyve sent in a particular timeframe.Create word blocklistsBlocklist certain words or phrases such as profanity to ensure that chat messages remain clear of offensive material. Block inappropriate words from messages Monitor specific conversations Analyse user data within timeframes Learn how FreeUp moderates thousands of chat users Now we can see how many clients and freelancers are interacting with one another.

He is making sure that Coosto builds the right things, the most relevant features and delivers value to their target audience.Paul told us how and why they added TalkJS to their array of features, and doing so offered more value to their customers and increased product engagement, while offering vital live chat capabilities to their customers.He explained how the TalkJS Chat API made it possible to integrate a chat feature into their SaaS product and the benefits of partnering up with us.The power of TalkJS is that its highly customizable and user-friendly. We feel very comfortable talking to customers about our chat integration, because we can offer them a plug and play solution and give them the possibility to adjust the chat widget to their needs. Paul van den Broek, Head of Product at CoostoAbout CoostoCoosto is a social media management platform that is focused on managing online content and conversations. Coosto helps businesses perform better in terms of customer satisfaction, brand reputation and awareness, and getting more conversions from their social media content. Its a robust platform used by 30.000 professionals and organizations, like Coolblue, Lidl, Mars, and TUI group. Coosto helps brands connect with people.Adding the chat into the Coosto platformThe Coosto platform does an amazing job with managing conversations from social media and messaging apps  but the product team from Coosto wanted to expand possibilities by creating a live chat feature similar to Intercom, Drift, or Zendesk. That way, businesses would be able to manage all online conversations in one place and stay in touch with their customers through all different social media platforms, and directly on their website.The idea was to offer a chat widget that Coosto customers could easily add to their website. Via the chat widget, people who are visiting a website, are able to directly chat with this business. Depending on the type of business, the purpose of the chat could be to offer direct support or to use it for marketing activities and convert website visitors into leads. For managing all incoming chat conversations, the customers of Coosto needed to have a chat interface inside the Coosto platform for managing these conversations.From a business perspective, the live chat would work as a new revenue stream by up-selling the feature to the customers of Coosto. They price the chat feature like a typical Saas product for a fixed price on a monthly basis.There were two options for them to add a chat into their SaaS product, by building the feature from scratch or using a chat API and SDK like TalkJS.We wanted to partner up with a chat vendor that is optimised for the use cases we are providing with a user-friendly chat solution in order to fit seamlessly into the Coosto platform.  Paul van den Broek, Head of Product at CoostoWorking with TalkJS Chat API  SDKCoosto got all the tools necessary to build the chat feature into their social media platform. The API works great with any language or framework, so the developers had no problems working with TalkJS code. The chat API allows developers to basically turn any div into a chat feature in a couple of hours.Using the Javascript chat library, the dev team was offloaded from a lot of front-end work as there was no need to design or code the user interface from scratch. The chat UI is pre-built and with a design thats easy to customize by changing a few lines of CSS.The product team at Coosto wanted to make the code snippet for the chat widget as small as possible. It was extremely important for them to provide their customers with a plug and play experience regarding chat implementation.We created a small code snippet for our customers to implement on their website to make sure it doesnt harm the loading time of your website. It works plug and play and can be installed directly on a website or integrated in Google Tag Manager. Paul van den Broek, Head of Product at Coostoscript var COOSTO_WEBCHAT_OPTIONS   appId App ID, companyName Brand Name, companyLogo Link to Company Logo, customerRole role, notificationsEnabled true, autoOpenDelay 1000, welcomeMessage Welcome to our chat. Please let us know if you have any questions.  scriptThere are also some variables in the code snippet that customers can customize themselves, like the name that appears in the live chat widget and the avatar that they have, and other branding elements.The TalkJS multi-licence partnershipThe partnership between Coosto and TalkJS gives customers of Coosto the flexibility to add live chat as an add-on to the Coosto platform they are already using. The collaboration between Coosto and TalkJS is a great fit for a SaaS company and makes it easy to distribute the chat feature to end-users.Theres always a lot of communication happening when starting a partnership and integration. Both parties had close contact with each other and we had great support from TalkJS when implementing the chat solution into the Coosto platform. This results in the possibility for us to offer more value towards our customers.

In fact, the only reason TalkJS tracks user information at all is so we can display a users name, send them email notifications, and so on.TalkJS is designed from the ground up around the idea that this data is your user data, and we only hold it for being able to deliver a good chat service. This means thatTalkJS only collects the user data that is needed to make TalkJS work, and nothing else.The JavaScript SDK is designed such that user data is synchronized all the time while theyre logged into your app.The last point means that in practice, TalkJS holds an up-to-date copy of your user. How this works is that each time a TalkJS Session is started, your code initializes the session with the users data. On a classical server-side rendered page, this happens every time the user navigates. This way, even when your user changes their information, itll be reflected at TalkJS right after.You can also use the REST API to programmatically synchronize user data at the appropriate time, if you prefer.The user IDWhen you send user data to TalkJS, you need to provide a user ID for each user. Each user ID must beUnique No two distinct users can have the same user ID.Permanent Once assigned, a user must always keep the same user ID. If you change a users user ID, the user might lose access to their chat.A best practice is just to use the user ID thats already used inside your own database.Any time someone loads TalkJS and identifies with a specific user ID, TalkJS can load that users old messages \u00e2 even on different devices. Authentication Identity verification makes this secure.Map multiple users to a single TalkJS userSometimes it can be effective to make a group of users act as a single TalkJS user. For example, a team of colleagues may want to chat on your platform with another person, but it should appear as if its a single person talking.In this case, send a user ID to TalkJS that is not the same as your users real ID. For instance, it might be appropriate to use the team ID for a TalkJS user ID.Make sure that user IDs dont collide. If you use increasing numbers for both your user IDs and your team IDs, then TalkJS will think that user 5 and team 5 is the same user. If this might happen, it may be better to prefix your TalkJS user IDs, for example turn it into team_5 and user_5 or something like that.User dataFieldTypeDescriptionExampleidstring  numberAs described above.12345, 2092ca38-6955-4d05-bc03-9c686648d9f4namestringThe users name or username - use whatever you want others to see when communicating with this user.LindaemailstringZero or more email addresses used for offline email notifications.

Ben Klenk, Co-founder  CEO, wanted to give these chefs an easy way to communicate with their customers, so he started looking for the right chat solution.TalkJS showed up in our search and seemed like the best option after looking through the documentation.Ben Klenk, Co-founder  CEO at HotplateAbout HotplateHotplate is changing the way people run food businesses. Instead of dealing with the headaches of traditional restaurantslike expensive leases, labor costs, and food wastehome chefs on Hotplate run pre-order-based businesses. They open sales at the start of the week, cook meals based on those orders, and handle customer pickups at the end of the week.This setup allows chefs to stay flexible, avoid unnecessary costs, and keep more of their profits. But to make the system work smoothly, communication between chefs and customers is key. Thats where TalkJS came in.Hotplate appThe ChallengeHotplate needed a chat system that would work well for both their team and their users. It had to integrate easily with their app and be flexible enough to fit their needs.The app is all about connecting home chefs with people who want home-cooked meals. We needed something simple and reliable to make that happen, Ben explained.But there were some roadblocks. Styling TalkJSs components to match Hotplates design required a lot of tweaking. What stood out, though, was the support teams responsivenessThe support was incredibly helpful. Its now the major reason well continue to stick with TalkJS.Hotplate inboxThe SolutionHotplate implemented TalkJS to power its in-app chat. The process was straightforwardtwo engineers got the feature up and running in just two and a half weeks. The flexibility of TalkJSs mix-and-match API made it easy for the team to start simple and add custom features over time.The flexibility lets us implement as we wishstarting simple and adding custom functionality as we go.Ben Klenk, Co-founder  CEO at HotplateDespite the challenges with styling, TalkJS allowed Hotplate to create a chat system that felt like a natural part of their platform.

Youll need to replace APP_ID with your own App ID, which you can find on the Settings page of your TalkJS dashboard. For this tutorial, we recommend using the App ID for TalkJSs Test Mode, which has built-in sample users and conversations which youll use in this tutorial. Youll also need to specify a current user to send messages as. In this example, youre setting me to be an existing user, the sample_user_alice sample user. For a user that already exists, you can call the Talk.User constructor with just their user ID.Next, use the getOrCreateConversation method to fetch the existing conversation with an ID of sample_conversation.Then you create the chat UI. Call the createChatbox method for a chatbox, createInbox for an inbox, or createPopup for a popup UI. Use the select method to display the sample conversation, and then use the mount method to render the UI. The methods here are linked for the chatbox, but are also available on the inbox and popup UI.For example, for the chatbox UI, you should see something like thisLoading chat...Try sending Sebastian a message! You can also try switching your userId to sample_user_sebastian and viewing the other side of the conversation.If you dont see the chat window, make sure that you entered your App ID, replacing APP_ID in the code.Create new users and conversationsSo far in this guide weve used a sample user and conversation. Next, well create new users and a conversation between them, and sync them with the TalkJS servers. Usually, you would create users based on the data from your database. For this getting started guide, weve hard-coded our user data instead.Modify your previous code by changing the highlighted linesChatboxInboxPopupJavaScript1Talk.ready.thenfunction  2 const me  new Talk.User3 id nina,4 name Nina,5 email email protected,6 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-7.jpg,7 welcomeMessage Hi!,8 9 const session  new Talk.Session10 appId APP_ID,11 me me,12 13 const other  new Talk.User14 id frank,15 name Frank,16 email email protected,17 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-8.jpg,18 welcomeMessage Hey, how can I help?,19 20 21 const conversation  session.getOrCreateConversationnew_conversation22 conversation.setParticipantme23 conversation.setParticipantother24 25 const chatbox  session.createChatbox26 chatbox.selectconversation27 chatbox.mountdocument.getElementByIdtalkjs-container28Heres what were doing in the updated versionWe create a new user with an ID of nina to be our current user. As this user is new, we pass the full user object to the Talk.User constructor rather than just the user ID.We create a TalkJS session and add our new current user as in the previous section.We create a second new user with an ID of frank.We use the getOrCreateConversation method to create a new conversation with an ID of new_conversation, and then add the two new users to the conversation with the setParticipant method.We create the UI, select the conversation, and mount the UI as in the previous section.When you mount the UI, the new users and conversation are synced with the TalkJS servers.You should now see something like thisIf you prefer, you can instead create and sync users or conversations from your backend with our REST API. If you want to only sync users or conversations with the REST API, you can disable syncing in the browser. See Browser Synchronization for more details.Next stepsIn this guide, youve added a powerful user-to-user chat to your app. You also learned more about the fundamentals of TalkJS, and how it all fits together.Most importantly, youve built a starting point to try out all the features TalkJS offers. For example, you could create a new UI theme in the Theme Editor, customize your chat with action buttons or HTML panels, or enable email notifications.For more ideas, try browsing the many examples we offer for different use cases.Before you go live, make sure you enable authentication. Authentication keeps your user data secure, by ensuring that only legitimate users can connect to your chat.

The main reason we chose TalkJS was their reputation, APIs, and ability to host the solution.Peter Lu Head of Product, RapidSOSRead case studyOne of the main reasons we chose TalkJS was the pricing.

A user has a session whenever they connect to the TalkJS servers, for example using any of the TalkJS SDKs or the REST API. With an active session, a user can receive new messages, unread message updates, and notifications. You can find your MAU count on the Activity page of your TalkJS dashboard, under Active users. MAU count isnt affected by how often a user connects. Whether a user with a unique user ID connects only once or a million times, they still count as one active user for that given month. Note that creating a session doesn\u00e2t yet add a user\u00e2s details to the TalkJS database. A user\u00e2s details are only added to the TalkJS database once a user with a session actually opens their chat. As a result, the Active users count can be larger than the number of users whose details you have in active conversations.Do you offer a free sandbox or development account? Yes, all plans include a forever free development mode. You get credentials for using TalkJS in production by going live \u00e2 this is the process of entering credit card information and going through checkout. Once you do that, you have two fully separate apps in the TalkJS dashboard, with two fully separate groups of users, conversations, and settings. You can then use the test app for development and testing, and the live app for your users.How many concurrently connected users can I have? While we dont have a hard limit on concurrent users, we typically consider fair usage for max concurrent connected users to be around 10 of MAU. While we wont immediately ask you to upgrade if you go over the limit sporadically, we will ask you to upgrade if its a regular occurrence.Can I use my TalkJS subscriptionAppID on multiple websites? A single TalkJS subscription can be used on one website or app. If youd like to use TalkJS on multiple websites or apps then youll need multiple subscriptions.How many users can I have in a group chat?The number of users that you can have in a single group chat depends on your planBasic Up to 100 participants, and up to 300 guests Growth Up to 300 participants, and up to 1250 guests Enterprise Customizable to fit your needsAny additional group chat users that exceed your plan are charged at a cost shown in the pricing calculator.

For example, users can have access to their inbox, but also chat via a popup widget.Inbox The TalkJS Inbox shows the chat history on the left, selected conversation on the right. Its designed to act as the messaging center of your app, usually living on its own page.Read the Inbox docsChatbox The Chatbox is just the right half of the Inbox UI mode. It takes up less space and is designed to be embedded in your app near an order confirmation, a booking, or user profile.Read the Chatbox docsPopup You can also show a conversation in a React popup that only shows up when the user clicks a button somewhere. When shown, the popup is positioned on the bottom right of your page.Read the Popup docs The power of TalkJS is that its highly customizable and user-friendly.

The following resources can help you integrate TalkJS into your appJavaScript SDKJavaScript Getting started guideBuild an Ionic chat app with TalkJSTo make everything work smoothly, also consider adding the following settings1. Add TalkJS to an allow listOn some platforms, you need to add the TalkJS URIs to an allow list to be able to load TalkJS. You can do this as followsUsing Cordova Allow List, add a Content Security Policy rule that allows access to https.talkjs.com.TalkJS uses Google Cloud to enable file sharing. If you use file sharing, also add httpsfirebasestorage.googleapis.com to the allow list.2. Allow external linksBy default, Cordova opens all links inside your app. If you would like your users also to be able to open links in the devices system browser, then install cordova-plugin-inappbrowser. Despite its name, this plugin includes a feature to avoid using an in-app browser.TalkJS automatically detects the presence of cordova-plugin-inappbrowser and ensures that external links open in the devices system browser.TroubleshootingThis section provides troubleshooting instructions for issues that you may come across.Chat isnt full widthIs the TalkJS chat UI not displaying at full width? Try one of the following Check that the WebView inside of which a website with the TalkJS UI is displayed is set to 100. TalkJS can only take up as much space as available within the WebView.Check that the width of the website thats inside the WebView is set to be the devices width. You can use the following code to fix the viewport width1meta2 nameviewport3 contentwidthdevice-width4If youre using one of the TalkJS mobile SDKs, then the width of the website inside the WebView is automatically set to be the devices width.Check that in the Layout section of the theme editor in your TalkJS dashboard, the width of the TalkJS UI is set to 100.Open external links and attachments on iOS React Native without SDKDid you implement React Native prior to the release of the React Native SDK? Then by default on iOS, if a user opens an external link or attachment from a chatbox, it opens in the same window and they wont be able to go back. To ensure that external links and attachments open correctly on iOS, you can use the onShouldStartLoadWithRequest callback. Once this callback is triggered, you can open the link in an external browser using React Natives Linking module, for example as follows1import  Linking, Platform  from react-native2 3const webview  React.createRef4 5return 6 WebView7 refwebview8 source html html, baseUrl baseUrl 9 TalkJS initialization code10 injectedJavaScriptinjectedJavaScript11 onShouldStartLoadWithRequestrequest  12 const url  request.url13 if 14 Platform.OS  ios 15 request.navigationType  click 16 Linking.canOpenURLurl17  18 Linking.openURLurl  Open link in separate Safari window.19 return false  Stops WebView from loading the clicked link.20 21 return true22 23 24",

For the full code for this example, see the Vue getting started example in our GitHub repo.PrerequisitesTo make the most of this guide, you needA TalkJS accountA Vue app that you want to add TalkJS toInstall TalkJSTo get started, install the talkjs packagenpmyarnSHELL1npm install talkjsAdd TalkJS to your appNext, add TalkJS to your app. Create a Chat.vue Single-File Component wherever you keep your components in your project.In Chat.vue, add a script tag with Vues setup attribute and import TalkJS1 Chat.vue2script setup3 import Talk from talkjs4scriptThen, for either a chatbox or an inbox pre-built chat UI, add this container element to the template of Chat.vue1 Chat.vue2template3 div idtalkjs-container stylewidth 100 height 500px4 iLoading chat...i5 div6templateIf youre adding a popup UI, you can omit this container, as the popup gets overlaid on top of your page. By default the popup displays in the bottom right corner, but you can change the position of the popup button on your page.You can then import this component in the place you want it in your app, for example in App.vue1 App.vue2script setup3 import Chat from .componentsChat.vue4script5 6template7 main8 Chat 9 main10templateView an existing conversationYou can now view a conversation. Add the following code to your Chat.vue fileChatboxInboxPopupJS1 Chat.vue2script setup3 import Talk from talkjs4 import  onMounted  from vue 5 6 onMounted  7 Talk.ready.then  8 const me  new Talk.Usersample_user_alice9 const session  new Talk.Session10 appId APP_ID,11 me me,12 13 14 const conversation  session.getOrCreateConversation15 sample_conversation16 17 conversation.setParticipantme18 19 const chatbox  session.createChatbox20 chatbox.selectconversation21 chatbox.mountdocument.getElementByIdtalkjs-container22 23 24scriptTo set up your chat as soon as the Chat component gets mounted, this code uses Vues onMounted lifecycle hook.Lets step through what the code inside Talk.ready.then is doingFirst, you make a connection to the TalkJS servers, known as a session. Youll need to replace APP_ID with your own app ID, which you can find on the Settings page of your TalkJS dashboard. For this tutorial, we recommend using the app ID for TalkJSs test mode, which has built-in sample users and conversations which youll use in this tutorial. Youll also need to specify a current user to send messages as. In this example, youre setting me to be an existing user, the sample_user_alice sample user. For a user that already exists, you can call the Talk.User constructor with just their user ID.Next, you use the getOrCreateConversation method to fetch the existing conversation with an ID of sample_conversation.Then you create the chat UI. Call the createChatbox method for a chatbox, createInbox for an inbox, or createPopup for a popup UI. Use the select method to display the sample conversation, and then use the mount method to render the UI. The methods here are linked for the chatbox, but are also available on the inbox and popup UI.Run your app. For example, for the chatbox UI, you should get something like the followingLoading chat...Try sending Sebastian a message! You can also try switching your userId to sample_user_sebastian and viewing the other side of the conversation.If the chat window doesnt show up, make sure that you entered your app ID, replacing APP_ID in the code.Create new users and conversationsSo far in this guide youve used a sample user and conversation. Next, youll create new users and a conversation between them, and sync them with the TalkJS servers. Usually, you would create users based on the data from your database. For this getting started guide, youll hard-code some user data instead.Modify your previous code inside Talk.ready.then by changing the highlighted linesChatboxInboxPopupJavaScript1 Chat.vue2Talk.ready.then 3 const me  new Talk.User4 id nina,5 name Nina,6 email email protected,7 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-7.jpg,8 welcomeMessage Hi!,9 10 const session  new Talk.Session11 appId APP_ID,12 me me,13 14 const other  new Talk.User15 id frank,16 name Frank,17 email email protected,18 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-8.jpg,19 welcomeMessage Hey, how can I help?,20 21 22 const conversation  session.getOrCreateConversationnew_conversation23 conversation.setParticipantme24 conversation.setParticipantother25 26 const chatbox  session.createChatbox27 chatbox.selectconversation28 chatbox.mountdocument.getElementByIdtalkjs-container29Heres what youre doing in the updated versionYou create a new user with an ID of nina to be the current user. As this user is new, you pass the full user object to the Talk.User constructor rather than just the user ID.You create a TalkJS session and add the new current user, as in the previous section.You create a second new user with an ID of frank.You use the getOrCreateConversation method to create a new conversation with an ID of new_conversation, and then add the two new users to the conversation with the setParticipant method.You create the UI, select the conversation, and mount the UI as in the previous section.When you mount the UI, the new users and conversation are synced with the TalkJS servers.You should now get something like the followingYou can also create and sync users or conversations from your backend with the REST API. If you want to only sync users or conversations with the REST API, you can disable syncing in the browser. See Browser Synchronization for more details.Thats it! You now have a working chat component in your Vue app.Next stepsIn this guide, youve added powerful user-to-user chat to your Vue app. You also learned more about the fundamentals of TalkJS, and how it all fits together.Most importantly, youve built a starting point to try out all the features TalkJS offers. For example, you could create a new UI theme in the Theme Editor, customize your chat with action buttons or HTML panels, or enable email notifications.Before you go live, make sure you enable authentication. Authentication keeps your user data secure, by ensuring that only legitimate users can connect to your chat.

Standard Changes will be communicated with Licensee in advance and are preformed within a predefined lead time. There are two Priority levels high and low priority Standard Changes.

It uses TalkJSs React Native SDK, which provides pre-built chat UI components for your application.In the guide well walk you through installing TalkJS, creating new users and conversations, and setting up push notifications.PrerequisitesTo make the most of this guide, you will needA TalkJS accountReact Native version 0.64 or higherA React Native app that you will add TalkJS to. If you dont already have one, you can follow the official guide to get started.Install TalkJSIf you use React Native without Expo, add the talkjsreact-native package to your project along with its dependenciesNote React Native CLI doesnt auto-link libraries with native modules when those libraries are transitive dependencies. To load the native modules correctly, you instead have to explicitly install the SDKs peer dependencies as shown in the following.yarnnpmBash1yarn add talkjsreact-native notifeereact-native react-native-communitypush-notification-ios react-native-firebaseapp react-native-firebasemessaging react-native-webview react-native-async-storageasync-storageIf you are targeting iOS, youll also need to add the following to your Podfile in your apps target section1pod Firebase, modular_headers  true2pod FirebaseCore, modular_headers  true3pod GoogleUtilities, modular_headers  true4RNFirebaseAsStaticFramework  trueAfterwards, run1npx pod-installInstall TalkJS ExpoFor Expo projects, install the talkjsexpo package instead alongside its dependencies1npx expo install talkjsexpo notifeereact-native react-native-webview react-native-async-storageasync-storage expo-build-propertiesThe talkjsexpo package is identical to talkjsreact-native in terms of features. talkjsexpo is just specifically designed to ensure compatibility with Expo.Configure NotifeeThis step is required for Expo users even if you dont plan to enable push notifications, otherwise building on Android will fail.The Notifee package requires its native modules to be defined under extraMavenRepos in your projects app.json as shownJSON12 expo 3 plugins 4  Other plugins5 6 expo-build-properties,7 8 android 9 extraMavenRepos 10 ....node_modulesnotifeereact-nativeandroidlibs11 12 13 14 15 16 17Import TalkJS in your componentImport TalkJS in the component where you want the chatbox to live.1import  as TalkRn from talkjsreact-nativeIf you are using the Expo package1import  as TalkRn from talkjsexpoCreate a TalkJS userFirst, create a TalkJS user in your chat component. The User object is used to synchronize user data, so that TalkJS can display the data inside the chat UI.For this guide youll create a TalkJS user using hard-coded values. You can also create the User object with data retrieved from your database. Or you can pass the object as a prop to the component that renders the chatbox.Function componentClass componentJavaScript1function ChatComponentprops 2 const me  3 id 123456789,4 name Alice,5 email email protected,6 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comimagesavatar-1.jpg,7 welcomeMessage Hey there!

A ConversationBuilder object creates a new conversation with the given participants and attributes, or modifies an existing conversation where necessary. Use the getConversationBuilder method to get the ConversationBuilder object.The oneOnOneId method computes a conversation ID based on participants IDs. Use this method if you want to create a conversation between two users. To create a group conversation or generate a conversation ID associated with a transaction on your platform, such as a purchase, follow the documentation on the conversation ID.Function componentClass componentJavaScript1const conversationBuilder  TalkRn.getConversationBuilder2 TalkRn.oneOnOneIdme, other3Next, set the participants of the conversation to the users you createdFunction componentClass componentJavaScript1conversationBuilder.setParticipantme2conversationBuilder.setParticipantotherRender the session and chatbox componentsThe Session component represents a users active TalkJS session.

You can get your appId from the Settings page of the dashboard.Function componentClass componentJSX1return TalkRn.Session appIdAPP_ID meme Youll need to replace APP_ID with your TalkJS App ID. You can find your App ID in the Settings tab of the TalkJS dashboard. For this tutorial, we recommend using the App ID for TalkJSs Test Mode.Finally, add the Chatbox component. The chatbox represents a messaging UI for a single conversation between two or more participants. It has only one required prop conversationBuilder. For an overview of all the props that the Chatbox supports, see Chatbox props.A Chatbox must be a descendant of Session. It doesnt need to be a direct descendant.

He told us all about how adding a chat between buyers and sellers to their platform saves them a lot of time with user support and the usual chasing up with various suppliers and customers. Learn all about their messaging setup and why they chose a SaaS chat instead of building it themselves.It was about helping our users. Before implementing chat we had to do a lot more support and chasing up. Matias Anaya, Software Engineer at KaddyAbout KaddyKaddy is a marketplace that connects alcohol suppliers with trade customers in order to remove the tedious barriers that get in the way of them doing business with each other.The Kaddy crew knows the ins and outs of the alcohol industry. They are striving to make ordering and payments as simple as possible so that venues can ditch the paperwork, and suppliers can focus on what they do best, producing great products.ChallengesThe team from Kaddy wanted to add chat to their marketplace as a way to facilitate communication between their customers and suppliers. There are many different kinds of conversations that suppliers and customers have as part of doing business with each other, and generally, these were happening outside of their platform. The problem with this was that it added friction, and a lot of the times, the context was lost.Also, at one moment, the Kaddy platform was growing fast, and they started to get business going between sellers and buyers that had never dealt with each other before as opposed to having a pre-existing relationship. It was immediately apparent that this group would benefit from 1-on-1 chat thats is embedded into their platform.SolutionMatias told us that they looked into setting up a Slack workspace that would be free for all users at first. The solution ended up feeling a bit too hacky for them, so they considered building the front-end themselves and paying for a backend only chat provider. But, that also meant that they had to build the email notifications feature from scratch.Finally, the dev team decided on using the TalkJS chat API and the Javascript chat library to set up a standard buyer-seller chat for their marketplace and connect their suppliers and customers.We chose TalkJS because it had email notifications built-in, apart from plug-and-play chat UI. Matias Anaya, Software Engineer at KaddyWith TalkJS, the integration didnt entail a lot of custom dev work. Both the chat UI and email notifications came out of the box. The developers also used TalkJS themes to customize the UI to fit their platform design. All of these factors made the frontend side of the integration super easy. There was no need to piece together the UI components and do the design. In other words, they were able to deploy the chat solution in a couple of hours and polish up things in the next few days.We would have had to spend more engineering time implementing our second choice which was more flexible and customizable, but not game-changing at the time, so we decided to use TalkJS. Matias Anaya, Software Engineer at KaddyKaddy also made use of the TalkJS email notification system. It makes possible to keep users in the loop across platforms. For example, if the user goes offline during a conversation, an email is automatically triggered and sent to that user with the chats message. The user can then reply to the email, and the message will land back in the chat closing the loop and making sure that the conversation is not lost.ResultsBy adding chat to their platform, the team from Kaddy managed to unload their customer support department significantly. The supplier and customers can now talk to each other without switching to Whatsapp, Slack, and email, bringing the user experience to a new level.What I can say is that we have 1000 conversations happening through chat that would have happened off-platform or not happen at all otherwise.

They wanted their users to be able to talk to each other directly on the website to work better together. Jun Minon, a Product Engineer at Xolo, was in charge of finding the best chat solution for this.Probably the winning factor of TalkJS compared to the competition is how quick it is to setup. I also love the documentation easy on the eyes, with a lot of code snippets to guide you.- Jun Minon, Product Engineer at XoloAbout XoloXolo aims to help freelancers and entrepreneurs by streamlining the administrative tasks of running a business, such as invoicing and tax management. Serving users in over 60 countries, Xolo is dedicated to improving the freelancing experience, making it as smooth and efficient as possible.Xolo dashboardThe challengeXolo faced two main challenges. One challenge was that they needed a chat solution that would fit with their current tech, which uses server-side rendering thru Spring MVC. This meant many available chat solutions werent suitable. Another challenge was that Xolo wanted its chat to improve user experience by allowing real-time talk among users, without making the platform harder to use or complicating the user interface.We needed support for vanilla Javascript since our application is using server-side rendering thru Spring MVC.- Jun Minon, Product Engineer at XoloChat inbox embedded into the dashboardThe solutionJun chose TalkJS after looking at several options. TalkJSs support for vanilla JavaScript and a flexible UI toolkit made it the perfect fit. Jun quickly integrated TalkJS into Xolo, setting up a fully functional chat within just a few days. This quick addition was a big win for Xolo, letting them roll out the new chat feature promptly.The management was really happy when I was able to demo a working end-to-end chat conversation in our platform in just a 2-3 day timeframe. The POC took less than an hour.- Jun Minon, Product Engineer at XoloPop-up chat on a user profile pageThe TalkJS chat transformed user interaction on Xolo. It allowed for instant messaging, which made collaboration easier. The TalkJSs customizable UI meant the chat looked like it was always part of Xolo, keeping the platform user-friendly. And today, the solution Xolo built is getting all the technical support they need for their growing chat user base.We requested a user batch update because we were about to enable email notifications and boom! The API was there in a couple of days. Kudos to the dev team.

A user has a session whenever they connect to the TalkJS servers, for example using any of the TalkJS SDKs or the REST API. With an active session, a user can receive new messages, unread message updates, and notifications. You can find your MAU count on the Activity page of your TalkJS dashboard, under Active users. MAU count isnt affected by how often a user connects. Whether a user with a unique user ID connects only once or a million times, they still count as one active user for that given month. Note that creating a session doesn\u00e2t yet add a user\u00e2s details to the TalkJS database. A user\u00e2s details are only added to the TalkJS database once a user with a session actually opens their chat. As a result, the Active users count can be larger than the number of users whose details you have in active conversations.Do you offer a free sandbox or development account? Yes, all plans include a forever free development mode. You get credentials for using TalkJS in production by going live \u00e2 this is the process of entering credit card information and going through checkout. Once you do that, you have two fully separate apps in the TalkJS dashboard, with two fully separate groups of users, conversations, and settings. You can then use the test app for development and testing, and the live app for your users.How many concurrently connected users can I have? While we dont have a hard limit on concurrent users, we typically consider fair usage for max concurrent connected users to be around 10 of MAU. While we wont immediately ask you to upgrade if you go over the limit sporadically, we will ask you to upgrade if its a regular occurrence.Can I use my TalkJS subscriptionAppID on multiple websites? A single TalkJS subscription can be used on one website or app. If youd like to use TalkJS on multiple websites or apps then youll need multiple subscriptions.How many users can I have in a group chat?The number of users that you can have in a single group chat depends on your planBasic Up to 100 participants, and up to 300 guests Growth Up to 300 participants, and up to 1250 guests Enterprise Customizable to fit your needsAny additional group chat users that exceed your plan are charged at a cost shown in the pricing calculator.

A user has a session whenever they connect to the TalkJS servers, for example using any of the TalkJS SDKs or the REST API. With an active session, a user can receive new messages, unread message updates, and notifications. You can find your MAU count on the Activity page of your TalkJS dashboard, under Active users. MAU count isnt affected by how often a user connects. Whether a user with a unique user ID connects only once or a million times, they still count as one active user for that given month. Note that creating a session doesn\u00e2t yet add a user\u00e2s details to the TalkJS database. A user\u00e2s details are only added to the TalkJS database once a user with a session actually opens their chat. As a result, the Active users count can be larger than the number of users whose details you have in active conversations.Do you offer a free sandbox or development account? Yes, all plans include a forever free development mode. You get credentials for using TalkJS in production by going live \u00e2 this is the process of entering credit card information and going through checkout. Once you do that, you have two fully separate apps in the TalkJS dashboard, with two fully separate groups of users, conversations, and settings. You can then use the test app for development and testing, and the live app for your users.How many concurrently connected users can I have? While we dont have a hard limit on concurrent users, we typically consider fair usage for max concurrent connected users to be around 10 of MAU. While we wont immediately ask you to upgrade if you go over the limit sporadically, we will ask you to upgrade if its a regular occurrence.Can I use my TalkJS subscriptionAppID on multiple websites? A single TalkJS subscription can be used on one website or app. If youd like to use TalkJS on multiple websites or apps then youll need multiple subscriptions.How many users can I have in a group chat?The number of users that you can have in a single group chat depends on your planBasic Up to 100 participants, and up to 300 guests Growth Up to 300 participants, and up to 1250 guests Enterprise Customizable to fit your needsAny additional group chat users that exceed your plan are charged at a cost shown in the pricing calculator.

For the full code for this example, see our GitHub repo.PrerequisitesTo follow this guide, you will need A TalkJS account.An Angular app that you want to add TalkJS to. If you dont have one yet, you can create an Angular starter app.Install TalkJSAdd the talkjs package to your appnpmyarnSHELL1npm install talkjsCreate a chat componentThe details of how and where you want to integrate TalkJS will depend on your existing app. For this example well use the generate component command to create a new talkjs-chat component in our project1ng generate component talkjs-chatNext, import your new component. In this example well import the component in our top-level app.component.ts file1import  Component  from angularcore2import  TalkjsChatComponent  from .talkjs-chattalkjs-chat.component3 4Component5 selector app-root,6 standalone true,7 imports TalkjsChatComponent,8 template  app-talkjs-chatapp-talkjs-chat ,9 styles ,1011export class AppComponent 12 title  angular-getting-started13View an existing conversationNext, view an existing conversation.

Youll need to replace APP_ID with your own app ID, which you can find on the Settings page of your TalkJS dashboard. For this tutorial, we recommend using the app ID for TalkJSs test mode, which has built-in sample users and conversations which well use in this tutorial. Youll also need to specify a current user to send messages as. In this example, youre setting me to be an existing user, the sample_user_alice sample user. For a user that already exists, we can call the Talk.User constructor with just their user ID.Next, use the getOrCreateConversation method to fetch the existing conversation with an ID of sample_conversation.Then you create the chat UI. Call the createChatbox method for a chatbox, createInbox for an inbox, or createPopup for a popup UI. Use the select method to display the sample conversation, and then use the mount method to render the UI. The methods here are linked for the chatbox, but are also available on the inbox and popup UI.For example, for the chatbox UI, you should see something like the followingLoading chat...Try sending Sebastian a message! You can also try switching your userId to sample_user_sebastian and viewing the other side of the conversation.If you dont see the chat window, make sure that you entered your app ID, replacing APP_ID in the code.Create new users and conversationsSo far in this guide weve used a sample user and conversation. Next, well create new users and a conversation between them, and sync them with the TalkJS servers. Usually, you would create users based on the data from your database. For this getting started guide, weve hard-coded our user data instead.Modify your previous code inside Talk.ready.then by changing the highlighted linesChatboxInboxPopupJavaScript1Talk.ready.thenfunction  2 const me  new Talk.User3 id nina,4 name Nina,5 email email protected,6 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-7.jpg,7 welcomeMessage Hi!,8 9 const session  new Talk.Session10 appId APP_ID,11 me me,12 13 const other  new Talk.User14 id frank,15 name Frank,16 email email protected,17 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-8.jpg,18 welcomeMessage Hey, how can I help?,19 20 21 const conversation  session.getOrCreateConversationnew_conversation22 conversation.setParticipantme23 conversation.setParticipantother24 25 const chatbox  session.createChatbox26 chatbox.selectconversation27 chatbox.mountdocument.getElementByIdtalkjs-container28 Heres what youre doing in the updated versionYou create a new user with an ID of nina to be the current user. As this user is new, you pass the full user object to the Talk.User constructor rather than just the user ID.You create a TalkJS session and add your new current user as in the previous section.You create a second new user with an ID of frank.You use the getOrCreateConversation method to create a new conversation with an ID of new_conversation, and then add the two new users to the conversation with the setParticipant method.You create the chat UI, select the conversation and mount the UI as in the previous section.When you mount the chat UI, the new users and conversation are synced with the TalkJS servers.You should now see something like the followingIf you prefer, you can instead create and sync users or conversations from your backend with our REST API. If you want to only sync users or conversations with the REST API, you can disable syncing in the browser. See Browser Synchronization for more details.Next stepsIn this guide, youve added powerful user-to-user chat to your Angular app. You also learned more about the fundamentals of TalkJS, and how it all fits together.Most importantly, youve built a starting point to try out all the features TalkJS offers. For example, you could create a new UI theme in the Theme Editor, customize your chat with action buttons or HTML panels, or enable email notifications.Before you go live, make sure you enable authentication. Authentication keeps your user data secure, by ensuring that only legitimate users can connect to your chat. For details, see Authentication.Full code exampleHeres what your final TalkJS chat component should look like, in fullChatboxInboxPopupTS1import  Component  from angularcore2 3import Talk from talkjs4 5Component6 selector app-talkjs-chat,7 standalone true,8 imports ,9 template 10 div idtalkjs-container styleheight 600pxLoading chats..div11 ,12 styles ,1314export class TalkjsChatComponent 15 constructor 16 Talk.ready.thenfunction  17 const me  new Talk.User18 id nina,19 name Nina,20 email email protected,21 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-7.jpg,22 welcomeMessage Hi!,23 24 const session  new Talk.Session25 appId APP_ID,26 me me,27 28 const other  new Talk.User29 id frank,30 name Frank,31 email email protected,32 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-8.jpg,33 welcomeMessage Hey, how can I help?,34 35 36 const conversation  session.getOrCreateConversationnew_conversation37 conversation.setParticipantme38 conversation.setParticipantother39 40 const chatbox  session.createChatbox41 chatbox.selectconversation42 chatbox.mountdocument.getElementByIdtalkjs-container43 44 45For full working code for this example, see the Angular getting started guide example GitHub repo.",

To understand all the intricacies of their implementation, we talked with Flo Crivello, the Founder, and CEO ex-head of product at Uber.About TeamflowTeamflow is a virtual headquarters that helps remote teams collaborate and communicate from a singular platform. The product caught the eye of some fantastic companies like Netflix, Uber, and Dropbox, which are now using it religiously. No wonder Flo and the team raised a total amount of 50 million in the year since their founding.Its best to describe their product as a virtual office for your team to hang out in. Bring back the presence of being in the office, the energy of working in the same room, the spontaneity of hallway conversations  the joy of feeling like a team.The challengeAt first, Teamflow only had a voice chat integrated into their platform. It worked like this when a person moved into the range of another they could talk. But soon it became apparent that people also wanted to message each other as the product team was getting a lot of feature requests for DMs.Not having customers being able to chat was costing us sales and revenue.- Flo Crivello, Founder  CEO at TeamflowOn top of that, the product also needed channels for particular rooms where people could chat in groups and leave messages asynchronously. All in all, integrating a chat feature became a priority, and they wanted to ship it fast.Shipping the chat feature in a few weeksTeamflow wanted to move fast and ship the feature as soon as possible. They chose TalkJS because of its pre-built UI that offloaded a lot of front-end work as there was no need to design or code the interface from scratch.We also considered Sendbird and Stream. TalkJS was very easy to integrate and gave us the flexibility we needed.- Flo Crivello, Founder  CEO at TeamflowThe TalkJS chat API provided the resources to connect all users with private direct messaging and create chatrooms for virtual rooms like the main floor of the office. Also, the API gave the developers the flexibility to custom build the chat header and easily add minor messaging features like emoji, file attachments, and typing indicators.The resultsThe chat Teamflow built by using TalkJS became a core part of their virtual office product. It made it possible to ship a fairly complex feature in just a few weeks, which delighted the customers who requested it and even had an impact on revenue.We havent exactly measured the impact, but probably 5 extra sales- Flo Crivello, Founder  CEO at Teamflow Share Share Share Share Share Email Copy Read next Product  Dec 9, 2024 How to pick the best white-label chat 2025 Discover the best white-label chat solutions with this expert guide.

They provide counseling and guidance with the help of dozens of trained volunteers that are trained by psychologists and therapists.At first, the volunteers were doing counseling by a phone call or email, but soon realized they could reach even more young people with their website. A real-time chat would provide faster support to those in need. The idea was to implement a chat solution where young people can contact their personal counselor.We talked with Jan Hj\u00f8rdie, the co-founder and developer at Aldrig Alene. He explained the ins and outs of their chat setup and looked back on the challenges they had with choosing the right solution.I think we have passed around 300.000 messages with the youngsters, and have helped several hundred. And even some of the really tough cases. Jan Hj\u00f8rdieChallengesAldrig Alene needed a chat platform where a large team of trained counsellors, more than fifty, can be easily available to anyone in need of help. Each young person has a dedicated counsellor they would talk to regularly.The main chat features they neededUsers can choose whom they want to talk toUsers can choose to be 100 anonymousA user always has the same adult to talk toComplete conversation history247 chat availabilityWhen they started looking for possible solutions, they tested multiple live chat providers, but none of them supported all the necessary features. Most of all, the possibility for users to continue the conversation where they left.I spent so much time testing LiveChat, until I found out you werent able to continue a conversation. And that was essential for our system! Jan Hj\u00f8rdieEssentially, what the Aldrig Alene team needed was a persistent chat. Where users can get back to the messages later, with complete conversation history.SolutionThey chose the TalkJS Chat API and created their own solution. The chat is embedded into their website and allows a particular young person to select their counselor and start a conversation.Using TalkJS meant that Aldrig Alene didnt need to worry about setting up infrastructure or building their own UI to power their real-time chat.It was lightweight, simple to implement, cost-effective and has great support. Jan Hj\u00f8rdieTalkJS ensures that ongoing conversations remain confidential, and that the children can remain in contact with their dedicated counsellor.ResultsAfter the chat went live on the Aldrig Alene website, they noticed that there are many more young people in need of help than previously thought. Up to now, the volunteers have exchanged more than 300.000 messages with young people.Nowadays, the chat solution is the primary tool they use for counseling. The young people can visit the website, see if their counselor is available, and immediately start a conversation. The solution allows the user to be anonymous, and it also preserves the entire conversation history for them.Aldrig Alene would definitely not be here today at that state we are now if we didnt have TalkJS on our website.

By setting that entry, you ensure that Firebase is enabled and can be used.Import TalkJS in your source filesImport TalkJS in the sources where you want the chatbox to live.1import packagetalkjs_fluttertalkjs_flutter.dartCreate a TalkJS sessionA session represents a TalkJS session and authenticates your app with TalkJS. To create a session, you need your app ID from the Settings page of your dashboard, and the current TalkJS user.1final session  SessionappId APP_IDYoull need to replace APP_ID with your TalkJS App ID. You can find your App ID in the Settings tab of the TalkJS dashboard. For this tutorial, we recommend using the App ID for TalkJSs Test Mode.Create a TalkJS userThe first step is to create a TalkJS user. The user object is used to synchronize user data with TalkJS, so you can display it inside the chat UI.1final me  session.getUser2 id 123456,3 name Alice,4 email email protected,5 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comimagesavatar-1.jpg,6 welcomeMessage Hey there!

The getConversation method attempts to get the conversation between the two users if the conversation already exists, or otherwise create a new conversation. The Talk.oneOnOneId method computes a conversation ID based on participants IDs. Use this method if you want to simply create a conversation between two users. You may want to create a group conversation or generate a conversation ID associated with a transaction that happened on your platform, such as a purchase. You can find how to do that in the documentation of the conversation ID.Also set the participants of the conversation to the users you created.1final conversation  session.getConversation2 id Talk.oneOnOneIdme.id, other.id,3 participants Participantme, Participantother,4Create the chatbox in your widget treeThe chatbox is one of the UI types of TalkJS.

You can modify the email notification that TalkJS sends directly from the Notifications page on your dashboard, in the Email settings section. Example notification emailTo avoid spamming the users inbox, TalkJS groups messages in an email notification and sends the notification only after a period of user inactivity. You can specify the period of inactivity after which TalkJS should send a notification in your dashboardEnable email notificationsTo enable email notifications for a user, make sure that the user has at least one email address on record. Any user with an email address automatically starts receiving email notifications as soon as they have been offline for a while. Users can have more than one email address, and TalkJS notifies all email addresses on record.Turn off email notificationsTo turn off email notifications for a user, you can remove their email on record by setting the users email field to null. You can also mute notifications for a particular conversation with the REST API. With notifications muted, your user wont receive any notifications for that conversation, including email notifications.Reply by emailTalkJS also supports reply by email, which allows users to continue a conversation when they have their chat closed. When a user receives a notification email about messages they missed, they can reply directly to that email, and their reply automatically shows up in the conversation.In the email notification, you can also link back to your app so that the user can easily rejoin the conversation.Users who only have Read access to a conversation can receive email notifications, but replies they send to a notification email wont show up in the conversation.Notifications for different user groupsIf you would like to have different email notifications for different users, create a separate role for each user group and adjust the email notification settings per role.Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to show different email notifications for different users.Unsubscribe linkAll email notifications include a link that unsubscribes the user. This is required to ensure that your emails are delivered reliably, as it is included in Googles requirements for large email senders.See Unsubscribe link customization for more details.Email notification domainsTo ensure that email notifications work smoothly, we recommend setting up a dedicated subdomain such as chat.yourdomain.com, or even on a fully new domain such as yourdomainchat.com, for email notification purposes. This practice helps you avoid any potential issues that could arise from having multiple mail servers on the same domain, in case you already use your main domain for email.Related topicsWebhooks provide several events related to email notifications, including notification.triggered, notification.sent, notification.delivered, notification.bounced, notification.opened, and notification.link.clicked.You can turn notifications on or off via the REST API, with operations on participants.Customize notification content",

A user has a session whenever they connect to the TalkJS servers, for example using any of the TalkJS SDKs or the REST API. With an active session, a user can receive new messages, unread message updates, and notifications. You can find your MAU count on the Activity page of your TalkJS dashboard, under Active users. MAU count isnt affected by how often a user connects. Whether a user with a unique user ID connects only once or a million times, they still count as one active user for that given month. Note that creating a session doesn\u00e2t yet add a user\u00e2s details to the TalkJS database. A user\u00e2s details are only added to the TalkJS database once a user with a session actually opens their chat. As a result, the Active users count can be larger than the number of users whose details you have in active conversations.Do you offer a free sandbox or development account? Yes, all plans include a forever free development mode. You get credentials for using TalkJS in production by going live \u00e2 this is the process of entering credit card information and going through checkout. Once you do that, you have two fully separate apps in the TalkJS dashboard, with two fully separate groups of users, conversations, and settings. You can then use the test app for development and testing, and the live app for your users.How many concurrently connected users can I have? While we dont have a hard limit on concurrent users, we typically consider fair usage for max concurrent connected users to be around 10 of MAU. While we wont immediately ask you to upgrade if you go over the limit sporadically, we will ask you to upgrade if its a regular occurrence.Can I use my TalkJS subscriptionAppID on multiple websites? A single TalkJS subscription can be used on one website or app. If youd like to use TalkJS on multiple websites or apps then youll need multiple subscriptions.How many users can I have in a group chat?The number of users that you can have in a single group chat depends on your planBasic Up to 100 participants, and up to 300 guests Growth Up to 300 participants, and up to 1250 guests Enterprise Customizable to fit your needsAny additional group chat users that exceed your plan are charged at a cost shown in the pricing calculator.

A user has a session whenever they connect to the TalkJS servers, for example using any of the TalkJS SDKs or the REST API. With an active session, a user can receive new messages, unread message updates, and notifications. You can find your MAU count on the Activity page of your TalkJS dashboard, under Active users. MAU count isnt affected by how often a user connects. Whether a user with a unique user ID connects only once or a million times, they still count as one active user for that given month. Note that creating a session doesn\u00e2t yet add a user\u00e2s details to the TalkJS database. A user\u00e2s details are only added to the TalkJS database once a user with a session actually opens their chat. As a result, the Active users count can be larger than the number of users whose details you have in active conversations.Do you offer a free sandbox or development account? Yes, all plans include a forever free development mode. You get credentials for using TalkJS in production by going live \u00e2 this is the process of entering credit card information and going through checkout. Once you do that, you have two fully separate apps in the TalkJS dashboard, with two fully separate groups of users, conversations, and settings. You can then use the test app for development and testing, and the live app for your users.How many concurrently connected users can I have?

To learn more about Classtime and their chat feature, we talked with Micha Riser, the CTO and a former Google engineer.We needed a chat feature. The lack of communication made Classtime less useful as a remote teaching tool, which is especially important during the covid pandemic. Micha Riser, CTO at ClasstimeAbout ClasstimeClasstime is a solution for classrooms that gives educators the tools they need to manage their classes, keep learners engaged with fun features like gamification, and provide instant grading and clear feedback to their students. They also aim to foster a global network of teachers by sharing question sets through their public library.Founded in 2016, Classtime was made with a mission in mind to show a clear path to student success. Today, they help millions of users across more than 60 countries connect and teach each other new skills every day, from school teachers and their students to education publishers and their clients.At Classtime we transform teaching and learning. Classtime engages and motivates all students, provides the teacher with learning insights, and delivers functionalities that make teaching more efficient  giving the teacher more time to teach. Jan Rihak, Founder and CEO at ClasstimeClasstime teachers viewThe Challenge of adapting to the remote classroomIn the Spring of 2020, schools around the world were switching to online classes due to the effects of the global pandemic. Both schools and their software providers needed to adapt quickly to the new remote teaching environment.Micha and his product team wanted to respond to this challenge as their platform was missing a messaging feature. Because of this, students and teachers needed to use third-party apps to talk about exams and assignments, which didnt do any favors to the overall learning experience.We needed a chat feature. The lack of communication made Classtime less useful as a remote teaching tool, which is especially important during the covid pandemic. Micha Riser, CTO at ClasstimeThe team from Classtime had an idea to allow teachers to communicate with students in the context of a Session, which is something like a quiz or test. To make this idea come to life, there were two options, building the chat feature from scratch or using a chat API.We decided on using a chat API, and besides TalkJS we were also thinking on using Pusher Chatkit. The main risks we considered were pricing, privacy concerns, and the difficulty of integration and maintenance. Micha Riser, CTO at ClasstimeConnecting students and teachers with in-app chatThe developers used the TalkJS chat API to create a 1-on-1 chat so that thousands of students and teachers can use it to communicate in real-time while being at home. They expected a significant number of active chat users from the start. Also, they added a file-sharing feature that comes out of the box with the API.One of the main reasons we chose TalkJS was the pricing. It was best aligned with our usage, as we have a large number of users but low usage per user. Micha Riser, CTO at ClasstimeThe TalkJS chat widget on the rightThe Javascript chat library is equipped with a pre-built chat UI with a design thats easy to customize by changing a few lines of CSS. It offloaded a lot of front-end work as there was no need to design or code the user interface from scratch.ResultsBy integrating the chat feature, Classtime transformed their platform and completely adapted it for remote teaching. It made wonders for the overall user experience as teachers and students could talk in real-time during a learning session and share learning materials.The teachers definitely use the chat a lot. If we had not built it wed have many customers not satisfied with our capabilities for remote teaching.

To get all the details, we talked with Rimvydas Vai\u010di\u016bnas, their Director of Marketing, who was in charge of the project.We considered building our own chat implementation, but we never did it because of high development, time and maintenance costs.- Rimvydas Vai\u010di\u016bnas, Director of Marketing at Atlantis GamesAbout Atlantis GamesAtlantis Games is a design studio based in Vilnius, Lithuania. They build innovative products for the gaming and esports industries. Their portfolio includes several successful e-commerce businesses, such as Eldorado.gg, which well showcase today, and many experimental projects. They are an ambitious team that simply loves video games and is excited about shaping the future of gaming.The challengeEldorado operates as a marketplace. Therefore, they need a way for two parties buyers and sellers to connect with each other. Its important for the parties to exchange the necessary service details, and for sellers to guide the buyer through the process from activation to delivery.Also, Eldorado has a support team to help users meet their needs. If there are any misunderstandings between the buyer and the seller, the support team can easily jump into the ongoing conversation and help solve any issues.Not having a chat platform put a lot of restrictions on our service and integrating it includes flexibility and smooth transactions.- Rimvydas Vai\u010di\u016bnas, Director of Marketing at Atlantis GamesAt Eldorado, some services can take from a few minutes to days, weeks, or even months to complete. A chat service was needed for the two parties to keep communicating and give updates on the ongoing process.We probably can live without it, but it would create a lot of development work, require more support assistance on every order and the whole process would take longer.- Rimvydas Vai\u010di\u016bnas, Director of Marketing at Atlantis GamesThe solution and resultsAt first, they considered building their own chat implementation, but never did because of the high development, time, and maintenance costs. Although there were common hesitations about using a third-party service because of possible downtime, the team from Eldorado decided to use TalkJS.We have searched for other solutions, with building a chat solution ourselves as a last resort. At that moment, TalkJS appeared to be exactly what we needed, and all other competitors seemed to be harder to integrate.- Rimvydas Vai\u010di\u016bnas, Director of Marketing at Atlantis GamesTalkJS met their criteria as a flexible Chat API that works great with Angular, and that it fits well with the one-page application that they use. Also, out of the options they considered, TalkJS seemed to be the most modern chat platform in terms of design, as it offers a customizable pre-built chat UI.Here are Rimvydas thoughts on TalkJS From day one, the solution worked perfectly. We cant compare it to anything. Eldorado is constantly growing, which also means more orders and more chats are being generated. TalkJS walked alongside us on this bumpy road. There were minor issues of downtime, but overall, TalkJS stood its ground and kept carrying the heavy load. Today, TalkJS is a vital cog for our service to operate successfully.

By default the popup displays in the bottom right corner, but you can change the position of the popup button on your page.View an existing conversationNext, well view an existing conversation. Choose the tab for your preferred chat UI, and add the following code to your appChatboxInboxPopupJavaScript1Talk.ready.thenfunction  2 const me  new Talk.Usersample_user_alice3 const session  new Talk.Session4 appId APP_ID,5 me me,6 7 8 const conversation  session.getOrCreateConversation9 sample_group_chat10 11 conversation.setParticipantme12 13 const chatbox  session.createChatbox14 chatbox.selectconversation15 chatbox.mountdocument.getElementByIdtalkjs-container16Lets step through what this code is doingFirst, we make a connection to the TalkJS servers, known as a session. Youll need to replace APP_ID with your own App ID, which you can find on the Settings page of your TalkJS dashboard. For this tutorial, we recommend using the app ID for TalkJSs Test Mode, which has built-in sample users and conversations which well use in this tutorial. Youll also need to specify a current user to send messages as. In this example, weve set me to be an existing user, the sample_user_alice sample user. For a user that already exists, we can call the Talk.User constructor with just their user ID.Next, use the getOrCreateConversation method to fetch the existing conversation with an ID of sample_group_chat.Then you create the chat UI. Call the createChatbox method for a chatbox, createInbox for an inbox, or createPopup for a popup UI. Use the select method to display the sample conversation, and then use the mount method to render the UI. The methods here are linked for the chatbox, but are also available on the inbox and popup UI.For example, for the chatbox UI, you should see something like thisLoading chat...Try sending Sebastian a message! You can also try switching your userId to sample_user_sebastian or sample_user_bob and viewing the other side of the conversation.If you dont see the chat window, make sure that you entered your App ID, replacing APP_ID in the code.Create new users and conversationsSo far in this guide weve used a sample user and conversation. Next, well create new users and a conversation between them, and sync them with the TalkJS servers. Usually, you would create users based on the data from your database. For this getting started guide, weve hard-coded our user data instead.Modify your previous code by changing the highlighted linesChatboxInboxPopupJavaScript1Talk.ready.thenfunction  2 const me  new Talk.User3 id nina,4 name Nina,5 email email protected,6 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-7.jpg,7 welcomeMessage Hi!,8 9 const session  new Talk.Session10 appId APP_ID,11 me me,12 13 const frank  new Talk.User14 id frank,15 name Frank,16 email email protected,17 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-8.jpg,18 welcomeMessage Hey, how can I help?,19 20 const juliana  new Talk.User21 id juliana,22 name Juliana,23 email email protected,24 photoUrl httpstalkjs.comnew-webavatar-1.jpg,25 welcomeMessage Hey, how can I help?,26 27 28 const conversation  session.getOrCreateConversationnew_conversation29 conversation.setParticipantme30 conversation.setParticipantfrank31 conversation.setParticipantjuliana32 33 const chatbox  session.createChatbox34 chatbox.selectconversation35 chatbox.mountdocument.getElementByIdtalkjs-container36Heres what were doing in the updated versionWe create a new user with an ID of nina to be our current user. As this user is new, we pass the full user object to the Talk.User constructor rather than just the user ID.We create a TalkJS session and add our new current user as in the previous section.We create two more new users with IDs of frank and juliana.We use the getOrCreateConversation method to create a new conversation with an ID of new_conversation, and then add the two new users to the conversation with the setParticipant method.We create the UI, select the conversation, and mount the UI as in the previous section.When you mount the UI, the new users and conversation are synced with the TalkJS servers.You should now see something like thisIf you prefer, you can instead create and sync users or conversations from your backend with our REST API. If you want to only sync users or conversations with the REST API, you can disable syncing in the browser. See Browser Synchronization for more details.Next stepsIn this guide, youve added a powerful group chat to your app. You also learned more about the fundamentals of TalkJS, and how it all fits together.Most importantly, youve built a starting point to try out all the features TalkJS offers. For example, you could create a new UI theme in the Theme Editor, customize your chat with action buttons or HTML panels, or enable email notifications.For more ideas, try browsing the many examples we offer for different use cases.Before you go live, make sure you enable authentication.

To learn more about their setup, we had a talk with Reggie Fernandes, the Country Head at Workbank Inc. Hes been leading a team of young professionals in the Philippines while working closely with the development team based in India.About WorkbankWorkbank is all about addressing recruitment challenges finding relevant talent for job positions in the fastest possible way by providing specific solutions to accelerate the process. The recruiting platform serves companies and job seekers in all industries, both in the Philippines and Qatar.At Workbank, we invest in talents not only by connecting them to job opportunities across the globe, but also by ensuring they are equipped with information and resources to help them be the most productive they can be. Reggie Fernandes, Country Head at WorkbankThe challengeEvery day thousands of recruiters and job candidates were interacting via email and phone calls after connecting on the Workbank job portal. But, Reggie and his team were hearing complaints from recruiters about having a hard time getting responses from candidates. Many job seekers who created profiles on Workbank were unresponsive to emails or phone calls from recruiters.The potential hires didnt like getting spammed with calls and emails. So, to tackle the low response rate from candidates and create a better hiring experience, Reggie and his product team decided to build a messaging solution to circumvent all the phone calls and emails.The ideal solution for them could be integrated fast without any custom development. Also, it needed to have a solid infrastructure that could handle spikes in user volume, connectivity, and an interface that brings a great user experience.Using a chat API to connect recruiters and candidatesAt first, they were thinking of building the messaging feature from scratch using open source but soon found out that it would take a lot more developer resources than expected. To ship the feature faster, they agreed on using a chat API, evaluated a few providers, and went along with TalkJS.Based on feedback from our IT department, TalkJS implementation process was easy, support was readily available, and the pricing was affordable. Reggie Fernandes, Country Head at WorkbankTo connect recruiters and candidates they used the TalkJS chat API and the Javascript chat library. The API offered advanced features like email notifications users can reply to without the need to visit the website chat. While the SDK was equipped with a pre-built chat UI with a design thats easy to customize by changing a few lines of CSS.The final product was a 1-on-1 chat they embedded into their platform that works just like any other modern messaging app and also keeps the users in the loop with email notifications while theyre offline.The resultsThe first thing Workbank noticed after integrating the chat was a spike in response rates as the candidates started talking with recruiters on the chat. Its still too early to get the exact figures because the chat is live for just a month or two, but the solution is working nonetheless. The chat integration led to a better hiring experience for candidates, which had an impact on the candidate response rate.Weve seen a significant uplift in use since going live and no complaints thus far.
