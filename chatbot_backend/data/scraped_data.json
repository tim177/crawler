Had we not chosen this path, the feature would have either been delayed due to the resources needed.Sean Elliot Engineering Manager, StyleSeatRead case studyWe wanted to create a solution that empowers clinics while keeping patients at the center of care.Sergiej Rewiakin Head of Tech, CasparRead case studyProbably the winning factor of TalkJS compared to the competition is how quick it is to setup. I also love the documentation easy on the eyes, with a lot of code snippets to guide you.Jun Minon Product Engineer, XoloRead case studyWe have a specific use case and we needed the platform to address our personally identifying information PII and security concerns. The main reason we chose TalkJS was their reputation, APIs, and ability to host the solution.Peter Lu Head of Product, RapidSOSRead case studyOne of the main reasons we chose TalkJS was the pricing. It was best aligned with our usage, as we have a large number of users but low usage per user.Micha Riser CTO, ClasstimeRead case studyNot having customers being able to chat was costing us sales and revenue. We also considered Sendbird and Stream. TalkJS was very easy to integrate and gave us the flexibility we needed.Flo Crivello Founder  CEO, TeamflowRead case studyWe wanted good system stability and were also looking at Sendbird. We went with TalkJS because it was cost efficient compared to the market.Virdienash Haqmal CPO, ItemkuRead case studyIf not for the chat we would continue to devalue our brand by not having FreeUp front and centre with both clients and freelancers at all times. We chose TalkJS because it was easy to deploy.Matt Harrison VP of Strategy, FreeUpRead case studyThe power of TalkJS is that its highly customizable and user-friendly. We feel very comfortable talking to customers about our chat integration, because we can offer them a plug and play solution and give them the possibility to adjust the chat widget to their needs.Paul van den Broek Head of Product, CoostoRead case studyWe chose TalkJS because it had email notifications built-in, apart from plug-and-play chat UI.

A user has a session whenever they connect to the TalkJS servers, for example using any of the TalkJS SDKs or the REST API. With an active session, a user can receive new messages, unread message updates, and notifications. You can find your MAU count on the Activity page of your TalkJS dashboard, under Active users. MAU count isnt affected by how often a user connects. Whether a user with a unique user ID connects only once or a million times, they still count as one active user for that given month. Note that creating a session doesn\u00e2t yet add a user\u00e2s details to the TalkJS database. A user\u00e2s details are only added to the TalkJS database once a user with a session actually opens their chat. As a result, the Active users count can be larger than the number of users whose details you have in active conversations.Do you offer a free sandbox or development account? Yes, all plans include a forever free development mode. You get credentials for using TalkJS in production by going live \u00e2 this is the process of entering credit card information and going through checkout. Once you do that, you have two fully separate apps in the TalkJS dashboard, with two fully separate groups of users, conversations, and settings. You can then use the test app for development and testing, and the live app for your users.How many concurrently connected users can I have? While we dont have a hard limit on concurrent users, we typically consider fair usage for max concurrent connected users to be around 10 of MAU. While we wont immediately ask you to upgrade if you go over the limit sporadically, we will ask you to upgrade if its a regular occurrence.Can I use my TalkJS subscriptionAppID on multiple websites? A single TalkJS subscription can be used on one website or app. If youd like to use TalkJS on multiple websites or apps then youll need multiple subscriptions.How many users can I have in a group chat?The number of users that you can have in a single group chat depends on your planBasic Up to 100 participants, and up to 300 guests Growth Up to 300 participants, and up to 1250 guests Enterprise Customizable to fit your needsAny additional group chat users that exceed your plan are charged at a cost shown in the pricing calculator.
